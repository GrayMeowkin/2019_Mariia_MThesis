\chapter{\abstractname}

In modern manufacturing engineering software tools are widely used on different stages of the engineering process. The tools influence the engineering process and have an impact on the overall efficiency. As the quality and efficiency of engineering processes have a strong impact on the economic success of production systems \cite{eval}, engineering process analysis and evaluation is an important issue. Different methodologies for engineering process analysis have been developed. Some of them focus on evaluation of engineering tools, some on consistent and lossless migration of information and engineering artifacts along the engineering activity and tool chain, some on engineering networks crossing company borders, and others have a strong information oriented focus \cite{eval}. Anyway software is an important factor in the engineering approach analysis, as in influences its speed, cost, quality and efficiency.\\ 

This thesis focuses on tool-based engineering approaches and evaluation of them on the example of the MaCon approach and the tool it offers. In this work we offer to evaluate the engineering approach by holding an experiment, where the approach and the tool would be used, capture the experiment and collect additional data like participants' feedback and perform the analysis and evaluation of the approach based of the information retrieved from the experiment. This work offers a methodology for preparing and conducting the experiment as well as a tool for further analysis of the collected data. We offer to integrate data collection into the engineering tool in order to capture the connection between inner software events and user feedback and collect the feedback according to the inner states of the system.\\

In this thesis we design and develop a tool for the experiment data analysis, which is focused on the collected feedback and media files.  The experiment that is described in the thesis shows an example of integrated data collection usage in a number of user studies and further analysis of the received data in the Analysis Tool. The approach is evaluated on 16 participants.\\
